        <h3> INTRODUCTION </h3>
        <p>
            This document describes a game called "The Tail of a City", a 2D top-down game in which the user controls and moves the character through keyboard inputs. The game will use sprite-based animation, tiled backgrounds, collision detection, physics, AI, side scrolling and gravity, efficient memory management, render threading, and more basic 2D game techniques.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3> TECHNOLOGY </h3>
        <p>
            This game will be created using the Phaser 3 Framework, and artwork will be created using Adobe Photoshop.
        </p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>BACK STORY</h3>
        <p>
            In an alternate reality in the beautiful streets of New York City masks unseen underlying problems that have been occurring for long enough; Pollution is increasing due to the growing number of Americans that are constantly polluting the roads and sidewalks, crime is beginning to incite fear on the citizens that have to go home every night after work, and many people are becoming homeless as a result of the city's poverty rates. Realizing the magnitude of the underlying issues, a group of dogs, known as the "K-9s", have all begun to work together as a unit to ensure the safety and cleanliness of the city.
        </p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>
        <p>
            The main objective of this game is to increase the user's reputation level by doing tasks and side quests to make sure the city stays safe and clean. Reputation is gained by doing main and side quests that promote good deeds, but reputation can also be lost if the user performs bad deeds publicly. Actions such as barking, picking up items, and attacking are some of the things that can be done to promote or lose reputation.
        </p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>GAMEPLAY</h3>
        <p>
            The character played will be a dog that the user chooses manually in the character selection screen. The user can choose to start at level 1, or choose a higher level once unlocked. Once the level begins, the user starts with a reputation level of 0 and spawns somewhere in the map. Surrounded throughout the map will be NPC dogs that offer different quests that the user can choose to do. However, these quests will vary on whether their reputation increases or decreases, and it is up to the user to determine which path they would like to take. (Good or evil dog)
        </p>
        <p>
            The user controls the character using the W, A, S, and D keys, and will be able to perform other actions such as barking, attacking, or picking up items in order to do these quests. Scattered throughout the map will also be NPCs in the form of humans and dogs, where they will also be allowed to move, see in a general direction, and perform actions like running and attacking. If an action by the user is performed in which they are seen by the humans and other dogs, the user’s reputation increases or decreases based on whether or not the NPCs are bad, and based on whether the action the user performs was towards a good or bad NPC. The NPCs will also be able to recognize whether the dog is good or bad and its general direction towards the dog doing an action.
        </p>
        <p>
            As reputation increases, the quests that the user will be able to do will increase in difficulty and length, such as having to perform more actions and having to deal with more enemies. The level ends when every NPC in the level recognizes the character, and the user’s reputation is carried towards the next level, where more quests, NPCs, and obstacles will be delivered. However, if the user dies before the level ends (this can occur as a result of the NPCs attacking the user based on their reputation), the user must restart the level starting at a reputation level of 0 and must work their way throughout the level to get back their original reputation level.
